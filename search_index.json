Open Health Imaging Foundation is developing an open source framework for constructing web-based medical imaging applications. The application framework is built using modern HTML / CSS / JavaScript and uses Cornerstone at its core to display and manipulate medical images. It is built with Meteor, a Node.js-based full-stack JavaScript platform.\nThis documentation concerns the OHIF framework itself and its three example applications: the OHIF Viewer, Lesion Tracker, and the Standalone Viewer.\nThe OHIF Viewer: A general purpose DICOM Viewer (demo)\n\nThe Open Health Imaging Foundation intends to provide a simple general purpose DICOM Viewer which can be easily extended for specific uses. The primary purpose of the OHIF Viewer is to serve as a testing ground for the underlying packages and the Cornerstone family of libraries.\nLesion Tracker: An oncology-focused imaging application (demo)\n\nThe Lesion Tracker is designed to facilitate quantitative assessments of tumour burden over time. It is similar in scope to the ePAD Imaging Platform (https://epad.stanford.edu/), developed at Stanford Medicine.\nStudy List & DICOM Connectivity\n\nThe solution provides a study list and other resources for connecting to PACS and other Image Archives through standard communication approaches (DICOM Web, DICOM Messages).\nStandalone Viewer (demo)\nThe Standalone Viewer offers only the client-side portions of the OHIF Viewer with the Study List pages removed. This single-page viewer can be hosted as a static site (e.g. on Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Github Pages), and easily integrated with existing back-end DICOM storage systems. Alternative Cornerstone Image Loaders can be included to allow your viewer to support non-DICOM objects (e.g. PNG, JPEG).\n"},"essentials/installation.html":{"url":"essentials/installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nGetting the Code\nEither clone the repository using Git:\ngit clone git@github.com:OHIF/Viewers.git\n\nor Download the latest Master as a ZIP File.\nSet up a DICOM server\n\nChoose and install an Image Archive\nUpload some data into your archive (e.g. with DCMTK's storescu or your archive's web interface)\nKeep the server running\n\nOpen Source DICOM Image Archive Options\n\n\n\nArchive\nInstallation\n\n\n\n\nDCM4CHEE Archive 5.x\nInstallation with Docker\n\n\nOrthanc\nInstallation with Docker\n\n\nDICOMcloud (DICOM Web only)\nInstallation\n\n\nOsiriX (Mac OSX only)\n\n\n\nHoros  (Mac OSX only)\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to make a Pull Request if you want to add to this list.\nSet up and test the OHIF Viewer (or LesionTracker) application:\n\nInstall Meteor\nOpen a new terminal tab in one of the Application directories (OHIFViewer or LesionTracker)\nInstruct Meteor to install all dependent NPM Packages\nMETEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS=\"../Packages\" meteor npm install\n\n\nRun Meteor using one of the available configuration files.\nMETEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS=\"../Packages\" meteor --settings ../config/orthancDICOMWeb.json\n\nNote: On Windows, you may need to set PACKAGE_DIRS=\"../Packages\" in your Environment Variables in your operating system settings.\n\nLaunch the OHIF Viewer / Lesion Tracker Study List by visiting http://localhost:3000/ in a web browser.\nIf everything is working correctly, you should see the Study List from your archive when you visit the Study List.\n\nDouble-click on a Study in the Study List to launch it in the Viewer\nIf everything is working correctly, you should see your study load into the Viewer.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you receive a \"No Studies Found\" message and do not see your studies, try changing the Study Date filters to a wider range.\nIf you see any errors in your server console, check the Troubleshooting page for more in depth advice.\n\n"},"essentials/getting-started.html":{"url":"essentials/getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\n...\n"},"essentials/architecture.html":{"url":"essentials/architecture.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\nMeteor\nMeteor is built on top of Node.js, adding reactive templates (Blaze), a publish/subscribe mechanism (via WebSockets and the Distributed Data Protocol, and a fully integrated client-server MongoDB making it easy to create reactive data elements in the UI.\nStructure of an OHIF Application\nThe OHIF Framework is built as a set of small Meteor packages which can be included as necessary in the final application. Since the logic and templates are largely pushed into packages, the actual application-specific code for each Viewer is relatively short.\nIn brief, to create a new Viewer application, you need to:\n\nDefine the existing pages and the routes which will lead to them\nDefine the overall application layout\nInclude child templates from the OHIF Packages into your application layout\nSpecify desired template options as necessary (e.g. which tools should appear in the toolbar)\n\nUser interface components for your application can be defined in any View layer supported by Meteor (Officially: Angular, React, Blaze, Unofficially: Vue).\n"},"essentials/configuration.html":{"url":"essentials/configuration.html","title":"Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Configurations\nThere are a few pre-defined settings files that you can find in config folder.

It is not a typical simple HTTP server. The bundled script redirects all URLs following the base URL to index.html. It will then use the routes defined in your application to handle the URL parameters.\n In our case, this means it will request a JSON file at baseURL/api/[id parameter].\n So if you navigate to http://localhost:3000/sampleJPEG.json the application will retrieve the JSON from http://localhost:3000/api/sampleJPEG.json and use it to populate the viewer.

Nobody wants to spend time guessing how to reproduce your issue! Before filing, please reproduce your issue more than once and clearly describe the steps taken.\nIf you are reporting a user interface issue, provide screenshots: A picture is worth a thousand words. If your issue concerns the UI, screenshots will help us identify the issue dramatically faster since it can be extremely challenging to describe UI bugs with text. You should still clearly describe the steps that you took to produce the issue.\nInclude platform & environment: Your operating system, web browser, and web browser version are highly relevant for many bugs. Please provide these with all bug reports.\nInclude expected and actual result: Tell us what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. If you don't do this, we might not consider it a bug.\n\nHow can I request a new feature?\nAt the moment we are in the process of defining our roadmap and will do our best to communicate this to the community. If your requested feature is on the roadmap, then it will most likely be built at some point. If it is not, you are welcome to build it yourself and contribute it. If you have resources and would like to fund the development of a feature, please contact us.\nWho should I contact about Academic Collaborations?\nGordon J. Harris at Massachusetts General Hospital is the primary contact for any academic collaborators. We are always happy to hear about new groups interested in using the OHIF framework, and may be able to provide development support if the proposed collaboration has an impact on cancer research.\nDo you offer commercial support?\nThe Open Health Imaging Foundation does not offer commercial support, however, some community members do offer consulting services. The following contacts may be useful:\n\nRob Lewis (Radical Imaging)\n\nPlease file a Pull Request if you wish to add your name or organization to this list.\nI emailed my question to you directly and you did not respond. Why not?\nEmailing developers directly is not a shortcut to faster support. Please file your issues and questions on Github so that everyone can benefit from the discussion and solutions.\nDo your Viewers have 510(k) Clearance from the U.S. F.D.A or CE Marking from the European Commission?\nNO. The OHIF Viewer, Lesion Tracker, and Standalone Viewer, NOT F.D.A. cleared or CE Marked. It is the users responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The License for the OHIF Framework does not prevent your company or group from seeking F.D.A. clearance for a product built using the framework.\nIf you have gone this route (or are going there), please let us know because we would be interested to hear about your experience.\nAre your Viewers HIPAA Compliant?\nNO. The OHIF Viewer, Lesion Tracker, and Standalone Viewer DO NOT fulfill all of the criteria to become HIPAA Compliant. It is the users responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations.\nThe Lesion Tracker application demonstrates some available components and features (e.g. Audit Trail, automatic logoff, and unique user identification for User Accounts) which could be used by third parties seeking HIPAA compliance.\n"},"faq/technical.html":{"url":"faq/technical.html","title":"Technical","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions - Technical\nWhy is your framework built with Meteor?\nAt the time of project conception, Meteor was a simple way to begin using bleeding edge web technologies without putting significant effort into configuration and build processes. Although Meteor does have some drawbacks, it remains a simple all-in-one solution.\nDo you have any plans to stop using Meteor?\nWe have considered migrating templates from Blaze (http://blazejs.org/) to React (https://reactjs.org/) or Vue (https://vuejs.org/), simply because these decouple the view layer from the remainder of the application. Blaze currently lacks Stand-alone Support which means that our templates are not re-usable outside of a Meteor application. This is certainly a downside, but the resource cost to migrate every template is significant.\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nI would like to contribute code - how do I do this?\nFork the repository, make your change and submit a pull request.\nAny guidance on submitting changes?\nWhile we do appreciate code contributions, triaging and integrating contributed code changes can be very time consuming.
